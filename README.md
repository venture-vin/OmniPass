#### <a name="why"></a>Why?

Identity is broken. Billions lack it. Yet every transaction, whether it be Basic Financial Services or Health Care, relies on Identity at the core. Here at Omnipass we imagined how we could reinvent Identity to compliment the “Smart City” of the Future. How could we take the advantages of Blockchain, “Security, Transparency, Immutability” and not only provide a robust verification system to serve as the foundation, but efficiently provide the basic necessities people would need - autonomously. We are proud to announce we will be launching a Pilot Program in Dubai very shortly.

#### <a name="description"></a> Description
The idea behind our dAPP is to have a user be able to verify their identity with any sort of government authority.

It would be a two-prong approach, where we would use a sort of an Oracle dAPP on the “authority” side in that would hold all the records and be able to sign and verify the user/traveler’s identity securely.

On the other hand our user will have their public facing identity verified that would allow them access to their visa status and any other temporary services. It would be achieved by a User contract that handles the identity attributes. Some of the more private parts would be hidden by a private/public key pair, where even though the legal name, user name, ID and birthday will be part of the person’s identity it will be encrypted, and only accessible with a private key.

Both dAPPs will communicate with each other via deployed contract data that would match the (the matching part is what we’re still working out right now) identity within the government/authority registry and the identity presented by the traveler.

Our app is deployed with truffle framework, on the testprc network, as it’s still in testing mode and we would like to build it further before deploying it on the ethereum network for the world to see.

We are also looking into using Microsoft’s Machine Learning Services to make the Data smarter. For example, in the field of Health Care - we could anticipate which neighborhoods are prone to certain illnesses.

Naturally, we will expand into payments facilitating contactless payments.
